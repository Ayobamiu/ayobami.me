      About Me – Usman Ayobami
    </h1>

    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
      I’m a software engineer based in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and a Master's
      student in Computer Science at

        class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline"
        >Western Michigan University</a
      >. I love building software that’s simple, helpful, and human-centered.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
      I'm currently a Software Engineering Intern at

        class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline"
        >Daylight Health</a
      >, where I contribute to building software that integrates mental health
      care into primary care practices. I help design and develop systems that
      improve how providers manage and deliver behavioral health services —
      supporting timely, coordinated care for patients who need it most.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
      My background is in petroleum engineering, but I pivoted into software
      after discovering how much I loved building things that solve everyday
      problems. I started my career at
      <a
        href="https://myafrilearn.com"
        target="_blank"
        class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline"
        >AfriLearn</a
      >, where I built educational tools for secondary students. Later, at
      <a
        href="https://panafricancapitalholdings.com/"
        target="_blank"
        class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline"
        >PanAfrican Capital</a
      >, I led a team building internal platforms for finance and HR.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
      I’ve co-founded ventures like
      <a
        href="https://www.lodgeek.com"
        target="_blank"
        class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline"
        >Lodgeek</a
      >
      (a property management tool) and contributed to the developer ecosystem
      with
      <a
        href="https://ayobamiu.github.io/geo-ng-web/"
        target="_blank"
        class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline"
        >GeoNG</a
      >, an open-source package for Nigerian geographical data.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
      Lately, I've been exploring machine learning — especially ways it can help
      people make smarter decisions. One project extracts subscriptions from
      email inboxes to help people cut unwanted costs.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
      Outside of work, I’m usually listening to music, learning something new,
      or dreaming about building a company that makes a meaningful difference in
      people’s lives.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
      I’m always open to conversations about product, engineering, education, or
      impact-driven tech.
